# How to Play #

## Introduction ##
Pitta pitta patta is a speed card game.

## Objective ##

Your objective is to put out as many cards as possible.

## Ending the game ##

The game ends when a player has rid themselves of all 13 of their home pile cards.

## Valid moves ##

To start, place an ace on one of the shaded squares in the middle.

A two of the opposite color can then be placed on the ace.

A three of the opposite color of the two can then be placed on the two, and so on.

## Variations ##

There are four main variations:
  1. "Same Color" -- instead of placing cards of opposite color on top of each other, place cards of the same color on top of each other.
  1. "Same Suit" -- instead of placing cards of opposite color on top of each other, place cards of the same suit on top of each other.
  1. "Backwards" -- instead of starting with an ace, start with a king and proceed downwards.
